# Physics-Inspired Machine Learning - Assignment 2

## Installation and Requirements
In this assignment, you'll be using a variety of PyTorch extensions including pytorch\_geometric, pytorch\_scatter, and pytorch\_cluster. We have found that installing all the required packages to be troublesome, so we have provided a docker container which will automatically build an environment for you. Alternatively, you are free to try and install all of the required packages yourself. Please post any questions to Ed. 

Issues with downloading torch geometric usually arise from having mismatched CUDA versions between the torch installation and the torch_geometric installation. If you have these issues, we suggest uninstalling anything torch related, first installing torch, then installing torch_geometric, making sure you are selecting the correct cuda and torch versions that match the torch installation.

### Self-installation with conda

```bash
# Install PyTorch version 2.1.0 - You MUST use this version
conda install pytorch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install --user pyg_lib torch_scatter torch_sparse torch_cluster torch_spline_conv -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.0+cu121.html
pip install --user torch_geometric
pip install --user ase wandb lmdb
```

### Docker Container (Recommended)
To use the docker container, you must be on a Linux based operating system and have an Nvidia GPU. 

**(0). Install pre-requisites.** For your distribution, install ```curl```. E.g. In Ubuntu: ```sudo apt install curl```.

**(1) Install Docker.**
Follow the instructions on: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

**(2) Install nvidia-container-toolkit.**
Redhat based distributions:

```bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nvidia-docker.repo

sudo yum install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Debian based distributions:
```bash
distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/$distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

If you are unsure of distribution you have, run either ```which apt```. If there is no output, you have a Redhat distribution; otherwise you have a Debian based distribution.

**(3) Building the container and running commands.**

To build the container, run ```python do.py build```. You only need to do this once.

To run a bash command in the container (e.g., ```python train.py```) use:

```bash
python do.py run --bash='$CMD'
```

To open an interactive terminal in the container, run ```python do.py run```.

**(4) Removing hanging containers.**

All running containers should exit and cleanup on their own when you finish. If they do not, run ```python do.py stop```.
